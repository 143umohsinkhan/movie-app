# Movie app

This is a demo React application, which is deconstructed to small and reuseable code components using [Bit](https://github.com/teambit/bit).

You can view the [resulted post-export scope](https://bitsrc.io/bit/movie-app) in BitSrc.

You can import each component individually from BitSrc.
